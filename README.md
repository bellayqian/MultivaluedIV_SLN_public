## Robust Learning Approaches for Assessing Effects and Effect Heterogeneity of Real-World Antipsychotic Treatment Regimes in Elderly Persons with Schizophrenia
### Advisor: Sharon-Lise Normand (Ph.D.), S. James Adelstein Professor. Harvard Medical School 

### Project Aims

1. Determine effectiveness of antipsychotic treatment regimens
2. Analyze effectiveness variations among subgroups (race/ethnicity, SDH)
3. Assess simultaneous impact of common regimens on multivariate outcomes

### Methods

- Outcome-weighted Estimators
- Longitudinal TMLE (Targeted Maximum Likelihood Estimation)
- Intensity of Exposure analysis
- Shared Forest approach for multivariate modeling

### Key Features

- Monthly follow-up for minimum 2 years
- Robust causal inference approaches
- Censoring and competing risk (death) consideration
- BART or Super Learner for weight estimation
- Isotonic regression for clinical interpretability
- Multivariate modeling of effectiveness and safety outcomes

### Outcomes

- Drug discontinuation
- Psychiatric hospitalizations/rehospitalizations
- Psychiatric ED visits
- Nonfatal suicide or self-harm
- Cardiometabolic morbidity
- All-cause mortality

### Analysis Tools

- Two Stage Least Square IV Analysis
- Deep Learning
